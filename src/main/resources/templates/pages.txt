Steps to Implement
Create the Controller:

Create a new Java class named DropdownController under your desired package (com.yourpackage.controller).
Copy and paste the controller code you provided into this class.
Create the Thymeleaf Template:

Navigate to src/main/resources/templates directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).
Create a new HTML file named dropdownValues.html.
Copy and paste the Thymeleaf template code provided earlier into this HTML file.
Verify Configuration:

Ensure your pom.xml (if using Maven) or build.gradle (if using Gradle) includes the necessary dependencies for Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, and JPA/Hibernate.
Verify that your Spring Boot application is correctly configured to scan for components (@ComponentScan) and that your application.properties or application.yml includes database configuration (if applicable).
Run the Application:

Start your Spring Boot application.
Navigate to http://localhost:8080/dropdown/values in your web browser (adjust the port if your application runs on a different port).
Additional Notes
Replace com.yourpackage with your actual package name where you're organizing your application’s classes.
Make sure your database connection and entity mappings (like Product) are correctly configured in your application to match the entity used in the JPQL query (SELECT e.name FROM Product e).
